# Project Description

Booking.com is a popular online travel agency that revolutionized the way travelers book accommodations. The platform addresses common challenges faced by travelers, such as limited access to information, inconvenience in booking, and difficulty in comparing prices. It provides a comprehensive solution by offering detailed accommodation information, a user-friendly interface, price comparison, and access to genuine reviews.

To bring the project to life, the Booking.com team followed a work plan that included market research, determining requirements, designing the user interface, implementing the system, testing, and regular updates.

The project requirements include functional and non-functional aspects. Functional requirements focus on user needs, such as searching and booking accommodations, accessing information, and customer support services. System requirements involve a reliable search engine, user-friendly filtering, API integration for detailed information, efficient media loading, multi-channel customer support, booking process, and a robust notification system.

Non-functional requirements cover aspects like uptime, performance, dependability, ethical considerations, security, accounting accuracy, and storage optimization.

The project includes activity diagrams, use case modeling, sequence diagrams, and class diagrams to represent processes, interactions, and system structure.
